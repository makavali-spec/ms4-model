This code involves analyzing the dataset using Markov-Switching models. The steps include reading and preprocessing the data, calculating daily returns, and normalizing them. A Markov-Switching model with four regimes is applied to identify different market conditions (bull, bull correction, bear, bear rally). The smoothed probabilities of these regimes are extracted. Finally, the data, including closing prices, log prices, realized volatility, and regime probabilities, is visualized, focusing on the first 500 rows to highlight specific trends and market behaviors over that period.
